Installation Details
--------------------------------------------------

Client (Local) machine:
-----------------------
Make sure Icarus has been shutdown, 
Place all your mod files (*.pak) in the game mods folder located here:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Icarus\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods

if the ...\mods directory does not exist, create it.


Server machine:
-----------------------
Make sure Icarus has been shutdown, 
Place all your mod files (*.pak) in the server game mods folder located here:

(drive):\<IcarusServerFolder>\Icarus\Content\Paks\mods

if the ...\mods directory does not exist, create it.

Use the exact same mods on both server and client machine or else run the risk of weird shit happening.
Usually the server will override anything running on the local machine(s), but match them to stay out of trouble.

Enjoy!
